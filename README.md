# Aux Scriptum

A writing assistant that uses local LLMs (through ollama) to proofread your texts.
This app is specifically meant for language learning, but you shall do with it what you will.

## CORS problem

Sometimes the app cannot talk with ollama due to CORS issues. The sollution is to set the OLLAMA_ORIGINS variable to *.
